#Planning

This app will used to track tournaments in model of NCAA Basketball tournament bracket.

-1. Tracks games played and their outcome(who won).
-2. Multiple competitors play on the tournament.
-3. Creates a tournament plan (who plays in what order).
-4. Schedules games.
-5. A single loss eleminates a player.
-6. The last player standing is the winner.

#assumptions:

-1. The aplication should be able too handle a variable number of players in a tournament.
-2. A tournament with less than the full complement of players/perfect number (a multiple of 2) should add in "byes". Basically, certain people selected at random get to skip the first round and act as if they won.
-3. Ordering who plays each other in the tournament should be random.
-4. Games aren't sheduled, they are playeed whenever the players want to play them.
-5. Each round should be fully completeed before the next round is displayed.
-6. System neeed to store a simplee score. Just a number for each pllayer. That way, the tracker can be flecible enough to handle a checkers tournament (the winner would have a 1 and the loser a 0)
-7. System will get at final an frontend like app or a website.
